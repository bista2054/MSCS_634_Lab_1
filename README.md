# Lab 1: Data Visualization and Statistical Analysis

## Purpose

This lab demonstrates how to perform data visualization, data preprocessing, and statistical analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Insights

- The histogram showed a roughly normal distribution in temperature.
- Box plots revealed outliers in monthly rainfall data.
- Correlation analysis identified strong positive correlation between humidity and rainfall.

## Challenges

- Dealing with large missing values in rainfall data.
- Choosing the right thresholds for outlier removal required careful inspection.
